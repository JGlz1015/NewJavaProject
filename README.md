Describe what you are trying to build, why do you want to build it, what it will be useful for, how it will be used, etc. 

I am trying to build a simple type of game where the main objective is for the shape to break the breaks while it bounces off a panel, which is controlled by the player. I wanted to build a game that could be fun and used for entertainment. I also want to learn what it takes  to build a game, while figuring out and  testing out the different aspects that go in it. This project will be useful for learning more about Java programming, and the GUIs. The way it is used is by controlling the panel using the arrow keys in your keyboard to try to break all the bricks without letting the shape hit the bottom. Also with this game the more you play,or when you lose and press enter, the next stage will show some obstacles.

User Manual:
To use this app, you would use you arrow keys on your keyboard to move the paddle around inorder to hit the blocks and complete the game, without letting the ball hit the bottom.
